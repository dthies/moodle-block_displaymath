moodle-block_displaymath
========================

This is a block that configures MathJax so that it plays nice with
TeX filter.

Place this directory in the Moodle installation /blocks foler. Visit admin
page to install to database. Set MathJax url in the settings either to
cdn or local install of MathJax.js.  Add block to course page and enable
TeX filter.

This is alpha software install on a developement server only. MathJax
should not already be configured, but TeX filter should.
