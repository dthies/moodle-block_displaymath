moodle-block_displaymath
========================

This is a block that configures MathJax so that it plays nice with
TeX filter.

Place this directory in the Moodle installation /blocks folder with the
name displaymath. Visit admin page to install to database. Set MathJax
url in the settings either to cdn or local install of MathJax.js.  Add
block to course page and enable TeX filter.

This is alpha software install on a developement server only. MathJax
should not already be configured, but TeX filter should.
